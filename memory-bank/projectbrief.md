# Project Brief: Senior Software Engineer Portfolio Website

## Vision
Build a fast, elegant, and experimental personal website that demonstrates senior-level engineering craft, taste, and problem-solving ability.

## Core Requirements
- **Performance**: Lighthouse ≥95 across all metrics
- **Speed**: Load instantly, LCP <1.5s on 4G
- **Engagement**: Delightful to explore in 60-120 seconds
- **Conversion**: Portfolio views → contact/intro call

## Primary Goals
1. Communicate who I am, what I do, and how I think (clarity > volume)
2. Demonstrate real engineering ability via small but impressive demos
3. Make it easy to contact me and evaluate my work in <2 minutes
4. Be maintainable: simple content model, low hosting cost, trivial deploys

## Target Audience
1. **Hiring Managers/Recruiters** (Primary): Skim credibility fast → confirm fit → book a call
2. **Engineers/Peers** (Secondary): Assess code quality/thinking → explore demos → star/follow
3. **Clients/Partners** (Tertiary): See case studies and delivery maturity → reach out

## Key Differentiators
- Live interactive demos (runnable code)
- Experimental features (code playground, visualizers)
- Performance-first architecture
- Single source of truth for resume + site content

## Success Metrics (MVP)
- Contact CTR: ≥3% of unique visitors
- Time on site: median ≥90s
- Demo Interaction Rate: ≥20%
- Resume downloads: ≥5%
- Performance: p75 LCP <1.5s, TTI <2.5s

## Scope (MVP)
- Home (hero + highlights + work preview + demos + contact)
- Work (3-6 case studies with metrics)
- Demos (3 interactive tiles)
- About (bio, values, skills, stack)
- Contact (email/socials)
- Auto-generated PDF resume

## Non-Goals (MVP)
- No blog engine/CMS
- No complex auth, comments, or payments
- No heavy 3D scenes that hurt performance
