# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
To create a personal portfolio that stands out in a crowded market by demonstrating actual engineering skill through interactive, performant experiences rather than just static content.

## Problems It Solves
1. **For Recruiters**: Quickly assess technical competency and cultural fit
2. **For Engineers**: Evaluate code quality and architectural thinking
3. **For Me**: Single maintainable source of truth for professional presence

## How It Should Work
- **First 15 seconds**: Visitor understands who I am and what I do
- **First 60 seconds**: Visitor sees proof of skills (metrics, demos)
- **First 2 minutes**: Visitor can contact me or download resume
- **Deep engagement**: Interactive demos show hands-on ability

## User Experience Goals
- **Fast**: Instant page loads, no waiting
- **Clear**: Skimmable hierarchy, strong typography
- **Delightful**: Subtle animations, smooth interactions
- **Accessible**: Works for everyone, keyboard navigable
- **Credible**: Professional polish signals attention to detail

## Content Philosophy
- Problem → Solution → Result (with metrics)
- Show, don't just tell (runnable demos)
- Explain like an engineer (trade-offs, learnings)
- Single source of truth (YAML → web + PDF)
